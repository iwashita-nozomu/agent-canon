description: "Use when analyzing accumulated AgentCanon skill/tool/workflow/hook/eval logs, missed or late skill invocation, routing misses, weak skills, over-constrained related-skill coverage, or selection gaps; reuse existing structured summaries and use bounded snapshot-qualified drilldown when needed. Archive maintenance, dashboard repair, and eval reruns are separate selected operations, not analysis prerequisites."
