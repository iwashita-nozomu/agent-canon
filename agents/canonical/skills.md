Public skill purpose, routing, and discovery paths are catalog-backed in
[`../skills/README.md`](../skills/README.md) and
[`../skills/catalog.yaml`](../skills/catalog.yaml).

Workflow-routed review, validation, and compatibility routines live in
[`../internal-routines/README.md`](../internal-routines/README.md).

Runtime alignment enforces that public skill docs, catalog IDs, and
`.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` shims stay in parity.
